# Development Guide

## Dependencies

This project uses modern Python packaging with `pyproject.toml`. Dependencies are managed as follows:

- Main dependencies are in `[project.dependencies]`
- Test dependencies are in `[project.optional-dependencies.test]`
- Development dependencies are in `[project.optional-dependencies.dev]`

### Working within a virtual environment
Create your python virtual environment:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --active
```

### Generating Requirements Files

If you need to generate requirements files (e.g., for deployment or specific environments):

#### Option 2 - Using uv:
```bash
# Install everything from lock file
uv sync --no-dev # Since dev are added by default

# Generate lock file with all dependencies
uv lock
```

### Installing Dependencies

#### Option 2 - Using uv:
```bash
# Install main package with test dependencies
uv sync --group test

# Install main package with all optional dependencies
uv sync --group vectorstore

# Install in editable mode
uv sync --editable
```

## Local Development

Sometimes you need to work with local changes from other Dapr repositories.

### Using Local Python Dapr Package Changes
If you need to work with additional Python Dapr packages during local development,
for example, those from [python-sdk](https://github.com/dapr/python-sdk) or [durabletask-python](https://github.com/dapr/durabletask-python),
then you can follow the same steps above and then install your local versions.
Adjust the paths as needed for your setup.

```bash
uv pip install -e ../durabletask-python \
   -e ../python-sdk \
   -e ../python-sdk/ext/dapr-ext-fastapi \
   -e ../python-sdk/ext/dapr-ext-workflow
```

You can also update `pyproject.toml` file to point to your local repo instead. For example, instead of:
```
"durabletask-dapr=>0.2.0a15",
```
You can use:
```
"durabletask-dapr @ file:///Users/samcoyle/go/src/github.com/durabletask-python",
```

### Using Local Dapr Runtime Changes
If you need to make changes relating to Dapr runtime during local development,
for example, those from [dapr](https://github.com/dapr/dapr) or [components-contrib](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib),
then follow these steps.

Working with local components-contrib changes:
1. Make your changes in components-contrib.
2. In `dapr/dapr`, update the root `go.mod` file to point to your local `components-contrib` repository. The override block is near the bottom to uncomment and adjust the path as needed.

#### Using the Dapr CLI with local dapr/dapr changes:
```bash
cd /cmd/daprd
go build -tags=allcomponents -v
cp daprd  ~/.dapr/bin/daprd
```

Once copied, the binary at `~/.dapr/bin/daprd` becomes the version used by `dapr run`.
Adjust this path as needed for your local setup.
Running `dapr version` should show the runtime as `edge`, which confirms your local build is being used.


## Command Mapping

| pip/pip-tools command | uv equivalent |
|----------------------|---------------|
| `pip-compile pyproject.toml` | `uv lock` |
| `pip-compile --all-extras` | `uv lock` (automatic) |
| `pip install -r requirements.txt` | `uv sync` |
| `pip install -e .` | `uv sync --editable` |
| `pip install -e ".[dev]"` | `uv sync --extra=dev` |
| `pip install -e ".[test,dev]"` | `uv sync --all-extras` |

## Testing

The project uses pytest for testing. To run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_random_orchestrator.py

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=dapr_agents
```

### Integration Tests

> Note: we do not use `pytest-docker-compose` intentionally here because it is not compatible with Python2,
and requires an old version of pyyaml < version6, but the rest of our project requires >6 for this pkg.

Requires Dapr CLI to be installed.

```
# Install test dependencies
pip install -e .[test]

# Set API key (required)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Run all integration tests
pytest tests/integration/quickstarts/ -v -m integration

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/integration/quickstarts/test_01_dapr_agents_fundamentals.py -v

# Run specific test func
pytest -m integration -v integration/quickstarts/test_01_dapr_agents_fundamentals.py::TestHelloWorldQuickstart::test_chain_tasks

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/integration/quickstarts/ -v -m integration --cov=dapr_agents
```

> Note: Parallel execution can be enabled with pytest-xdist using -n auto or -n <num>. Example: `pytest -n auto -m integration`.

To use an existing venv to speed up local development time, then you can update the quickstarts to set `create_venv` to `True` as a parameter in `run_quickstart_script`. Alternatively, you can set the env var setting: `USE_EXISTING_VENV=true`.

## Code Quality

The project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Run linting
uv run flake8 dapr_agents tests --ignore=E501,F401,W503,E203,E704

# Run code formatting
uv run ruff format

# Run type checking
uv run mypy --config-file mypy.ini

## Run all combined
uv run ruff format && uv run flake8 dapr_agents tests --ignore=E501,F401,W503,E203,E704 && uv run mypy --config-file mypy.ini && uv run pytest tests -m "not integration"
```

## Pre-Push Hooks

This project uses pre-commit hooks to automatically run quality checks before pushing code to GitHub. These hooks catch issues in ~10 seconds instead of waiting 5-10 minutes for CI.

### Installation

1. Install pre-commit framework (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   uv pip install pre-commit
   # or
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. Install the git hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
   ```

3. (Optional) Run manually on all files to verify setup:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage pre-push
   ```

### What Gets Checked

When you run `git push`, the following checks run automatically:

1. **File hygiene** - Trailing whitespace, end-of-file fixes
2. **YAML validation** - Check component config files
3. **Code formatting** - Ruff auto-formats code
4. **Linting** - Flake8 checks for code issues
5. **Type checking** - MyPy validates types
6. **Unit tests** - Pytest runs ~256 unit tests (excluding integration tests)

These checks mirror the CI/CD pipeline, catching issues before they reach GitHub.

### Running Hooks Manually

```bash
# Run all pre-push hooks without pushing
pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage pre-push
# Or use the Makefile shortcut
make hooks-run

# Run all hooks PLUS integration tests (comprehensive check, slower)
make hooks-run-all

# Run individual checks (same commands as before)
uv run ruff format dapr_agents tests
uv run flake8 dapr_agents tests --ignore=E501,F401,W503,E203,E704
uv run mypy --config-file mypy.ini
uv run pytest tests -m "not integration"
```

### Skipping Hooks (Emergency Only)

If you absolutely must push without running hooks:

```bash
git push --no-verify
```

**Note:** Use sparingly - CI will still catch issues, but this defeats the purpose of local validation.

### Troubleshooting

**"Hook failed to run"**
- Ensure dependencies are installed: `uv sync --group dev --group test`

**"Tests are failing"**
- Run tests locally to see details: `uv run pytest tests -m "not integration" -v`
- Fix failing tests before pushing

**"First run is slow"**
- First-time execution downloads pre-commit repositories (~30s)
- Subsequent runs are cached and fast (~10s)

**Performance**
- Expected runtime: 8-12 seconds (pre-push hooks only)
- Expected runtime: 2-5 minutes (with `make hooks-run-all` including integration tests)
- Only checks staged files where possible
- Integration tests NOT included in pre-push hooks (too slow - use `make hooks-run-all` for comprehensive local check)

## Development Workflow

### Option 1 - Using pip:
1. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync --group test
   ```

2. Run tests before making changes:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests -m "not integration"
   ```

3. Make your changes

4. Run code quality checks:
   ```bash
   uv run flake8 dapr_agents tests --ignore=E501,F401,W503,E203,E704
   uv run ruff format
   uv run mypy --config-file mypy.ini
   ```

5. Run tests again:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests -m "not integration"
   ```

6. Submit your changes

## To run pre-commit hooks
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## To run the Metadata Schema Generator
TODO(@casperGN): to pls add in when we should run this, when it gets ran in CI, how to avoid local versions from getting committed, etc.
```
uv run python scripts/generate_metadata_schema.py --version X.X.X
```

## Design/Behavioral Decisions

### DurableAgent Durability
   Scenarios:
   1. every time we run the same app instance any inflight workflow will be resumed.
   1.1 caveat here is wf will continue but you will not get the result.
   2. every time i have a .run() or invoke new workflow via curl or pubsub then a new workflow instance id will be created. If there is an inflight workflow already then it will be resumed, and the new one will be created.
   3. Trace ID = workflow ID and make the tracing pick up from where it left off.

### Internal class structuring/setup
When to use Pydantic vs dataclasses:
- Use Pydantic for:
  - Data crossing trust boundaries or is persisted: API payloads, pub/sub messages, persisted state (workflow state, timeline messages, trigger/broadcast schemas, tool records, etc.).
  - Schemas requiring coercion, validation, or versioned migrations.
- Use dataclasses for:
  - Agent construction knobs you pass in code (ie agent config classes).
  - Dependency injection of services/stores/policies and behavior hooks.

Mental model:
- Think “config vs data”:
  - Config you wire at construction time → dataclasses.
  - Data the system processes/persists at runtime → Pydantic.


### Using the env-template resolver

For Dapr component files that reference environment variables (e.g., `{{OPENAI_API_KEY}}` or `${{OPENAI_API_KEY}}`), use the helper to render a temporary resources folder and pass it to Dapr:
```bash
dapr run --resources-path $(quickstarts/resolve_env_templates.py quickstarts/01-dapr-agents-fundamentals/components) -- python 03_durable_agent.py
```

The helper scans only `.yaml`/`.yml` files (non-recursive), replaces placeholders with matching env var values, writes processed files to a temp directory, and prints that directory path.
